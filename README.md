This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data course at Carnegie Mellon University!

# About me
Hello! My name is Ashita Vadlamudi (pronouns: she/her). I am a graduate student in the *Healthcare Analytics and Information Technology* program at Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to graduate school, I worked at the National Institutes of Health as a researcher studying the genetic basis of brittle bone disease. As an undergrad, I worked in other labs that conducted research on breast cancer and opioid addiction. Through these research projects, I have had the opportunity to work directly with data and various analytical tools to develop meaningful insights and drive future work. Following graduation, I hope to be working in consulting and learning more about different industries through hands-on projects. 

# What I hope to learn
Through this course, I hope to learn different data visualization techniques and tools to effectively and accurately convey the story behind numbers. I would also like to learn more about the design aspects of data visualization including choosing the right colors, fonts, spacing, etc. Furthermore, I would like to learn about the common pitfalls in data visualization and how to overcome them.

## Final Project

Please check out my final project **[here](https://preview.shorthand.com/uC6eBRpQWEdTaCO0)**. It is a data story about the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease in the United States and what we can do to reduce our risk of developing this condition. 

## Week 1
During week 1, I delivered a critique of a data visualization found in an article on The Economist about the political situation in the United Kingdom. Here’s a sneak peek of the original visualization.

## Week 2
During week 2, I was tasked with reviewing the [Management Alert](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/Mga/2019/oig-19-51-jul19.pdf) report published by the Office of the Inspector General regarding the ongoing crisis at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities at the southwest border. Following this, I designed data visualizations to convey one key aspect of the report to two different audiences: 1) general newsreaders, and 2) policymakers and high-level government officials. 

I also delivered a critique of a separate data visualization about the truth behind the phrase “Midwestern nice”. In the original article published on The Economist, the authors assess volunteer rates across the United States to evaluate if there is any basis for this phrase. Here’s the original visualization.

## Week 3
Heading into week 3, I started thinking about my final project for the course. I started browsing online through many data repositories and read numerous articles to identify a topic that caught my attention and interest. While I was doing this, I came across an article about the prevalence of cardiovascular disease on National Public Radio (access [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/07/11/740895106/cutting-just-300-calories-per-day-may-keep-your-heart-healthy)). I delved deeper into this topic and you can read more about my progress [here](/final_project_Ashita.md).

In addition to the final project, I was explored and learned how to use another open-source visualization tool called RAW Graphs. I was provided with a dataset about Debt as a percentage of GDP by country and explored different unique chart types to highlight different messages in the data. Please check out my visualizations [here](/dataviz2.md).

## Week 4
During week 4, I continued to develop my story arc for my final project. I continued to explore additional datasets apart from the ones I identified during week 3 to help support my story. I designed a draft version of my data story on Shorthand and also conducted user research to get feedback from my target audience about the story, visualizations, design, information, etc. Please check out my progress [here](/final_project_Ashita_pt2.md). 

## Week 5
During week 5, I implemented the feedback I received from my user research and finalized my data story on Shorthand. I was also tasked with telling my story in class in **60 seconds** supplemented with the visualizations from my final data story on Shorthand. 

Here's a the 60-second sneak peek of my story: 

*"Did you know that cardiovascular disease causes death every 40 seconds. That means by the time I am done with this presentation, someone would have been affected by this condition. So how exactly did we end up here? Well, data since 1960 indicates a steady rise in calorie consumption. Not only that, but we have also been consuming more of the bad stuff such as sugars and fats and less of the good stuff such as fruits and vegetables. So what can we do now to reduce our risk? One study suggests cutting 300 calories from your diet. But what is "300 calories"? Well, it is either one McDonald's Cheeseburger or one Tall Caramel Frappucino from Starbucks. But it is important to be aware of what you eat more than how much you eat. So at your next meal, I urge you to stop, think, and eat the right foods because, remember, a healthy diet leads to a healthy heart."*
