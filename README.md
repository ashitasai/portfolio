This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data course at Carnegie Mellon University!

# About me
Hello! My name is Ashita Vadlamudi (pronouns: she/her). I am a graduate student in the *Healthcare Analytics and Information Technology* program at Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to graduate school, I worked at the National Institutes of Health as a researcher studying the genetic basis of brittle bone disease. As an undergrad, I worked in other labs that conducted research on breast cancer and opioid addiction. Through these research projects, I have had the opportunity to work directly with data and various analytical tools to develop meaningful insights and drive future work. Following graduation, I hope to be working in consulting and learning more about different industries through hands-on projects. 

# What I hope to learn
Through this course, I hope to learn different data visualization techniques and tools to effectively and accurately convey the story behind numbers. I would also like to learn more about the design aspects of data visualization including choosing the right colors, fonts, spacing, etc. Furthermore, I would like to learn about the common pitfalls in data visualization and how to overcome them.

## Week 1
### Critique by redesign - Data visualization from Datawrapper
<iframe title="UK Political Trends: A Social Media Snapshot" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-n8BkP" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/n8BkP/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="339"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>

**Few thoughts:**

The bar chart was an appropriate and effective choice in the original visualization posted in the article. I chose to maintain the same chart type for my redesign. With a few additional changes, I believe my proposed redesign is/has:
- Easier to read and understand because of the clear segmentation between candidates and political parties
- A more informative title
- Consistent typograhphy in labels

However, in both the original and my proposed redesign, it would have been more effective to display the percentage of likes out of the total number of posts made by each candidate / political party (although this would depend on what data is available). 

## Week 2
### Critique by redesign - Data visualization from Google Sheets

**Context:**
The original article was posted on The Economist. Apart from catching up on the major headlines each day, the audience of this news outlet enjoys reading about topics that provide them with additional general knowledge. In this case, the article’s goal is to assess if there is any truth to the phrase “Midwestern nice”. The authors show one measure of “niceness” through a map illustrating the volunteer rates across the U.S. 

**Note:** The dataset used to create the visualization in the original article showed 2017 volunteer rates. However, this data was no longer available. I used the 2018 volunteer rates and they followed the same trend as the previous year.

- "State Rankings by Volunteer Rate" Corporation for National and Community Service, [https://www.nationalservice.gov/serve/via/rankings](https://www.nationalservice.gov/serve/via/rankings)

**Few thoughts:** 

The map was an appropriate and effective choice in the original visualization posted in the article. I chose to build off of this concept by redesigning the map and a few other changes including: 
- Equal sized squares for representing each state 
- A color gradient to represent the volunteer rate
- Consistent usage of state abbreviations as labels

As a result of these changes, I believe my proposed redesign: 
- improves upon the "truthfulness" scale - it is more accurate, valid, and reliable and does not misrepresent the underlying data
- effortless to understand
- simple yet aesthetically pleasing

### OIG Report Data Visualizations - Data visualization from Infogram
#### Perspective 1: Data Journalist

**Audience:**

In this case, my audience consists of daily newsreaders of the NPR news outlet. This audience prefers to get a quick summary of the major headlines without too much unnecessary detail. They either listen to the news on TV or radio or read the daily headlines online. 

**Purpose:**

In this case, I chose to provide a brief overview of the crisis at the southern border. To help narrate the story, I chose to design two data visualizations. My goal is to make two key points: 
1)	To show that there is overcrowding and prolonged detention at several Border Patrol facilities in the Rio Grande Valley
2)	To show that this is due to high volume of apprehensions on the southern border

To make the first point, I chose a doughnut chart to show the total number of detainees and the percentage of people held for 72+ hours to illustrate prolonged detention. This information was presented in the text of the OIG report, but I felt it would be more effective to show the same information in a simple chart as it will help readers truly understand the scale and impact of the crisis.
