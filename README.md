This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data course at Carnegie Mellon University!

# About me
Hello! My name is Ashita Vadlamudi (pronouns: she/her). I am a graduate student in the *Healthcare Analytics and Information Technology* program at Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to graduate school, I worked at the National Institutes of Health as a researcher studying the genetic basis of brittle bone disease. As an undergrad, I worked in other labs that conducted research on breast cancer and opioid addiction. Through these research projects, I have had the opportunity to work directly with data and various analytical tools to develop meaningful insights and drive future work. Following graduation, I hope to be working in consulting and learning more about different industries through hands-on projects. 

# What I hope to learn
Through this course, I hope to learn different data visualization techniques and tools to effectively and accurately convey the story behind numbers. I would also like to learn more about the design aspects of data visualization including choosing the right colors, fonts, spacing, etc. Furthermore, I would like to learn about the common pitfalls in data visualization and how to overcome them.

## Week 1
### Critique by redesign - Data visualization from Datawrapper
<iframe title="UK Political Trends: A Social Media Snapshot" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-n8BkP" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/n8BkP/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="339"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>

### Few thoughts:

The bar chart was an appropriate and effective choice in the original visualization posted in the article. I chose to maintain the same chart type for my redesign. With a few additional changes, I believe my proposed redesign is/has:
- Easier to read and understand because of the clear segmentation between candidates and political parties
- A more informative title
- Consistent typograhphy in labels

However, in both the original and my proposed redesign, it would have been more effective to display the percentage of likes out of the total number of posts made by each candidate / political party (although this would depend on what data is available). 

## Week 2
### Critique by redesign - Data visualization from Google Sheets

**Note:** The dataset used to create the visualization in the original article showed 2017 volunteer rates. However, this data was no longer available. I used the 2018 volunteer rates and they followed the same trend as the previous year.

### Few thoughts: 

The map was an appropriate and effective choice in the original visualization posted in the article. I chose to build off of this concept by redesigning the map and a few other changes including: 
- Equal sized squares for representing each state 
- A color gradient to represent the volunteer rate
- Consistent usage of state abbreviations as labels

As a result of these changes, I believe my proposed redesign: 
- improves upon the "truthfulness" scale - it is more accurate, valid, and reliable and does not misrepresent the underlying data
- effortless to understand
- simple yet aesthetically pleasing
