**Few thoughts:**

The bar chart was an appropriate and effective choice in the original visualization posted in the article. I chose to maintain the same chart type for my redesign. With a few additional changes, I believe my proposed redesign is/has:
- Easier to read and understand because of the clear segmentation between candidates and political parties
- A more informative title
- Consistent typograhphy in labels

However, in both the original and my proposed redesign, it would have been more effective to display the percentage of likes out of the total number of posts made by each candidate / political party (although this would depend on what data is available).
