### Section 1: Outline
**Potential Title:** Healthy diet, Healthier heart  
**Summary:** Cardiovascular disease is one of the top 5 leading causes of death in the United States. However, risk of developing the disease can be reduced by maintaining a healthy diet. 

**Project Structure:**  
**1)** Introduce major alarming statistic: Heart disease kills 1 person every 40 seconds.  
- Discuss heart disease prevalence by state  
- Zoom in on PA and emphasize that we have a relatively high prevalence

**2)** Discuss measures that can be taken to reduce risk of developing heart disease. 
- Briefly talk about article on NPR - Research shows that cutting 300 calories from your diet reduces your risk by x amount
- Show calorie consumption patterns in PA
- Show recommended federal guidelines for a healthy diet

**3)** Call to action
- Now don't get me wrong, I am not telling you to cut 300 calories from your daily diet. All I am asking you to do is to be more aware of what you put in your body at your next meal and every meal thereafter.
