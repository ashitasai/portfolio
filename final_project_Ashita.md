# Final Project
## Part I
### Section 1: Outline
**Potential Title:** Healthy diet, Healthier heart  
**Summary:** Cardiovascular disease is one of the top 5 leading causes of death in the United States. However, risk of developing the disease can be reduced by maintaining a healthy diet. 

**Project Structure:**  
**1)** Introduce alarming statistic: Heart disease kills 1 person every 40 seconds.  
- Discuss heart disease prevalence by state  
- Emphasize the fact that heart disease has remained the leading cause of death for over a decade

**2)** Discuss measures that can be taken to reduce risk of developing heart disease. 
- Briefly talk about article on NPR - Research shows that cutting 300 calories from your diet reduces your risk by x amount
- Show calorie consumption patterns in the United States
- Show recommended federal guidelines for a healthy diet

**3)** Call to action
- Now don't get me wrong, I am not telling you to cut 300 calories from your daily diet. All I am asking you to do is to be more aware of what you put in your body at your next meal and every meal thereafter.

### Section 3: Data Sources
**Note:** I chose to use data from a few different sources. I decided to combined the data from these sources into one Excel file, which can be accessed here.

**1)** American Heart Association - I was directed to this data source through an article I came across on NPR. The statistic I convey in my first visualization was derived from this source. I plan on using this alarming fact as a hook to engage my audience at the beginning of my presentation.

**2)** Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - I obtained mortality rates of heart disease by state over the past decade from this data source. I will use this data in the form of heatmaps as shown in my initial sketches to provide my audience with some context about my topic. More importantly, I will use this data to convey that heart disease remains to be the leading cause of death in the United States.

**3)** 


â€¢	A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

### Section 4: Method and Medium
I plan on using Shorthand to narrate my story. I will use the major points outlined in the project structure as the subsections or "chapters" in my story. I plan on mainly using data visualizations with minimal text to convey the story. Overall, my goal is to convince my audience to be more aware of what they put in their bodies at every meal with the hope that they will slowly shift towards eating more healthy foods. 

For my final presentation, I will use snapshots of my Shorthand page to convey the key points in under the 60 second requirement. I do not plan on using PowerPoint slides to supplement my presentation.
