# Final Project
## Part I
### Section 1: Outline
**Potential Title:** Healthy diet, Healthier heart  
**Summary:** Cardiovascular disease is amongst the leading causes of death in the United States. However, risk of developing the disease can be reduced by maintaining a healthy diet.

**Project Structure:**  
**1)** Introduce alarming statistic: Heart disease kills 1 person every 40 seconds.  
- Discuss heart disease prevalence by state  
- Emphasize the fact that heart disease has remained the leading cause of death for over a decade

**2)** Discuss measures that can be taken to reduce risk of developing heart disease. 
- Briefly talk about article on NPR - Research shows that cutting 300 calories from your diet reduces your risk by x amount
- Show calorie consumption patterns in the United States
- Show recommended federal guidelines for a healthy diet

**3)** Call to action
- I am not telling you to cut 300 calories from your daily diet. All I am asking you to do is to be more aware of what you put in your body at your next meal and every meal thereafter.

### Section 3: Data Sources
**Note:** I chose to use data from a few different sources. I decided to combined the data from these sources into one Excel file, which can be accessed here.

**1)** American Heart Association - I was directed to this data source through an article I came across on NPR. The statistic I convey in my first visualization was derived from this source. I plan on using this alarming fact as a hook to engage my audience at the beginning of my presentation. 

**Source:** "Heart disease and stroke statistics 2017 At-a-Glance" American Heart Association, 2017. [https://healthmetrics.heart.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Heart-Disease-and-Stroke-Statistics-2017-ucm_491265.pdf](https://healthmetrics.heart.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Heart-Disease-and-Stroke-Statistics-2017-ucm_491265.pdf)

**2)** Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - I obtained mortality rates of heart disease by state over the past decade from this data source. I will use this data in the form of heatmaps as shown in my initial sketches to provide my audience with some context about my topic. More importantly, I will use this data to convey that heart disease remains to be the leading cause of death in the United States. 

**Source:** "Heart Disease Mortality by State" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, January 1, 2019. [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/heart_disease_mortality/heart_disease.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/heart_disease_mortality/heart_disease.htm)

**3)** Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - I found a report that summarized calorie consumption patterns by food group, gender and age. I will use this data to highlight the historic food consumption patterns in the United States relative to the recommended guidelines. 

**Source:** "Table 56. Mean macronutrient intake among adults aged 20 and over, by sex and age: United States, selected years 1988-1994 through 2011-2014" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017, https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/056.pdf

**4)** Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion - This source provided me with the recommended consumption guidelines for different food groups. I will use this data in combination with the data from the previous source to identify any red flags in food consumption patterns. This will help serve as strong evidence to convince my audience to be more aware of their eating patterns.

### Section 4: Method and Medium
I plan on using Shorthand to narrate my story. I will use the major points outlined in the project structure as the subsections or "chapters" in my story. I plan on mainly using data visualizations with minimal text to convey the story. Overall, my goal is to convince my audience to be more aware of what they put in their bodies at every meal with the hope that they will slowly shift towards eating healthier foods. 

For my final presentation, I will use snapshots of my Shorthand page to convey the key points in under the 60 second time limit. I do not plan on using PowerPoint slides to supplement my presentation.
