# Final Project - Part II

## Section 1 - Wireframes & Storyboards

For this section of the project, I chose to begin building my story on Shorthand itself. Access my story at _____.

Last week, I created a few visualizations: 
1) statistic about cardiovascular disease
2) a heat map showing prevalence of heart disease across the United States over time
3) a range plot to show where we our current diets stand relative to the recommended guidelines

However, over the past week, I further contemplated the story I want to tell and thought about what I would want to learn if I was the audience and someone presented this information about cardiovascular disease to me. It came down to  upon further thought and additional feedback that I received from several sources over the past week, I realized that some of this data is irrelavant to my story.
