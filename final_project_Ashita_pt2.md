# Final Project - Part II

## Section 1 - Wireframes & Storyboards

For this section of the project, I chose to begin building my story on Shorthand directly. Access my story at _____.

Last week, I created a few visualizations: 
1) Statistic about cardiovascular disease
2) A heat map showing prevalence of heart disease across the United States over time
3) A range plot to show where our current diets stand relative to the recommended guidelines

**Note:** Access last week's updates [here](/final_project_Ashita.md). 

However, over the past week, I further contemplated the story I want to tell and thought about what I would want to learn if I was the audience and someone presented information about cardiovascular disease to me. It came down to 3 key points: 

1) What is the current status of disease prevalence? How significant is it?
2) What have we been doing wrong that has led us here?
3) How can we correct it?

Once I broke it down, I realized that some of the data and visualizations I created last week may not really add much value to my story. Here are the changes I made: 

1) I chose to no longer use the data about prevalence of cardiovascular disease across the United States - this is not the story I want to tell, I just need to know one piece of information to drive home the point that cardiovascular disease prevalence is high and I should be concerned. I felt the statistic graphic was sufficient for this purpose. 

2) I liked the idea of the range plot to show where we stand relative to what is recommended, but I had access to a limited amount of data which did not let me make an apples-to-apples comparison. Upon further research, I found data on total daily calorie consumption trends over the past 5 decades broken down by food group. I decided to use this data for my main visualizations (found on my Shorthand page). 

My updated data for the final project can be accessed [here](/FP_Data_Updated).
