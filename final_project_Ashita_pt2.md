# Final Project - Part II

## Section 1 - Wireframes & Storyboards

For this section of the project, I chose to begin building my story on Shorthand itself. Access my story at _____.

Last week, I created a few visualizations: 
1) Statistic about cardiovascular disease
2) A heat map showing prevalence of heart disease across the United States over time
3) A range plot to show where we our current diets stand relative to the recommended guidelines

However, over the past week, I further contemplated the story I want to tell and thought about what I would want to learn if I was the audience and someone presented this information about cardiovascular disease to me. It came down to 3 key points: 

1) What is the current status of disease prevalence?
2) What have we been doing wrong that has led us here?
3) How can we correct it?

Once I broke it down, I realized that some of the data and visualizations I created last week may not really add much value to my story. Here are the changes I made: 

1) I chose to no longer use the data about prevalence of cardiovascular disease across the United States - this is not the story I want to tell, I just need to know one piece of information to drive home the point that cardiovascular disease prevalence is high and I should be concerned. 

2) I liked the idea of the range plot to show where we stand relative to what is recommended, but I had access to a limited amount of data which did not let me make an apples-to-apples comparison. I instead chose to share data on calorie consumption trends over the past 5 decades and broke it down by food group. 

My updated data for the final project can be accessed here.
