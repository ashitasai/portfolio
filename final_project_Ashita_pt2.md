# Final Project - Part II

## Section 1 - Wireframes & Storyboards

### Changes to final project

Last week, I created a few visualizations: 
1) Statistic about cardiovascular disease
2) A heat map showing prevalence of heart disease across the United States over time
3) A range plot to show where our current diets stand relative to the recommended guidelines

**Note:** Access last week's updates [here](/final_project_Ashita.md). 

However, over the past week, I further contemplated the story I want to tell and thought about what I would want to learn if I was the audience and someone presented information about cardiovascular disease to me. It came down to 3 key points: 

1) What is the current status of disease prevalence? How significant is it?
2) What have we been doing wrong that has led us here?
3) How can we correct it?

Once I broke it down, I realized that some of the data and visualizations I created last week may not really add much value to my story. Here are the changes I made: 

1) I chose to no longer use the data about prevalence of cardiovascular disease across the United States - this is not the story I want to tell, I just need to know one piece of information to drive home the point that cardiovascular disease prevalence is high and I should be concerned. I felt the statistic graphic was sufficient for this purpose. 

2) I liked the idea of the range plot to show where we stand relative to what is recommended, but I had access to a limited amount of data which did not let me make an apples-to-apples comparison. Upon further research, I found data on total daily calorie consumption trends over the past 5 decades broken down by food group. I decided to use this data for my main visualizations (found on my Shorthand page). 

My updated data for the final project can be accessed [here](/FP_Data_Updated).

### Wireframes

For this section of the project, I chose to begin building my story on Shorthand directly. Access my story at _____.

I have 3 key visualizations along with several images of different foods to convey my story. 
1) Statistic about cardiovascular disease
2) Bar chart showing trend in total daily calorie consumption in the United States over the past 5 decades
3) Line graph showing the daily calorie breakdown by food group over the same time period

I additionally used imagery to quantify the "300 calories" and visually convey good versus bad foods towards the end of my story (See below for more details).

### Storyboard

1) My story starts off by grabbing the attention of the audience through a bright and alarming statistic showing the prevalence of cardiovascular disease.

2) I take a step back to provide a little background as to what actually led us to the current state by looking into overall calorie consumption and breakdown by food group. I believe this gets the audience to start thinking about their own diets. 
  
3) I added some text to help recap the story so far and also use this as a transition to direct focus towards what we need to change to be more aligned with the recommended USDA guidelines for a balanced diet. 
    - I introduced the article by NPR which quoted a study that showed that you can reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease by cutting 300 calories from your diet as it helps reduce the associated risk factors such as cholesterol, weight, etc. 
    - I used common foods to help quantify "300 calories".
    
4) I added some text to transition to the the recommended USDA guidelines and provide tips for the audience with some imagery to help visuallly convey the message.

5) I conclude with my call to action - "Stop. Think. Eat." and also provide a link that leads to publicly available resources to help my audience be more aware of their diets and choose the right foods.
