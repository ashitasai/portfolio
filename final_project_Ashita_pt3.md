# Final Project

Please access my final data story [here](https://preview.shorthand.com/uC6eBRpQWEdTaCO0).

## Background
While thinking about potential topics for my final project, I was browsing through news articles online. I found an article on NPR concerning cardiovascular disease. I knew that this condition had a high prevalence in the United States, but I was not aware that it caused death every 40 seconds. I became very interested in learning more about the causes of this condition and the precautionary measures we can take. I learned that many of the precautionary measures required long term changes in lifestyle such as increasing physicial activity and controlling diet. Knowing that I will be presenting to a young audience for my final presentation, I felt that it would be important to make people more aware of this condition and measures they can take early on in their lives to help reduce their risk. As a result, I continued my search to find data sources and construct the story I want to tell. 

## Part I 
What I did: 
- Outlined my project
- Created a story arc
- Documented my data sources
- Designed draft visualizations of my data
- Identified the method and medium I will use to present my story

## Part II
As I continued doing additional research, I found new data sources that were more relevant to the story I wanted to tell. As a result, I chose to eliminate a few of the data sources I initially found in completing Part I. 

What I did: 
- Identified new data sources
- Developed initial sketches of visualizations
- Created a draft version of my Shorthand page
- Conducted user research

## Part III
My intended audience for my final data story is composed of anyone who is looking for tips and resources to help them reduce their risk of developing cardiovascular disease. This could be inviduals who are health conscious in general or those that have been cautioned by their doctors to closely watch their health due to existing medical signs that signal a risk of developing heart disease. While more elderly people might be interested in my story, I also hope to reach out to the younger population to help raise awareness and foster a healthier diet early on.

Definining my audience helped me make better design choices. For instance, I chose to quantify "300 calories" by using common foods that my audience would be familiar with. I also chose to use pictures with minimal text to convey the message in a simple way. I constructing my data visualizations, I chose familiar chart types such as bar and line graphs as they are very easy to interpret. 

Additionally, the user research I conducted in Part II helped me identify the problem points in my story design and visualizations. Since many of the comments I received pertained to technical changes, I chose to reach out again to the same indivudals to identify the underlying issues. I found out that
