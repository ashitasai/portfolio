# Final Project

## Background
While thinking about potential topics for my final project, I was browsing through news articles online. I found an article on NPR concerning cardiovascular disease. I knew that this condition had a high prevalence in the United States, but I was not aware that it caused death every 40 seconds. I became very interested in learning more about the causes of this condition and the precautionary measures we can take. I learned that many of the precautionary measures required long term changes in lifestyle such as increasing physicial activity and controlling diet. Knowing that I will be presenting to a young audience for my final presentation, I felt that it would be important to make people more aware of this condition and measures they can take early on in their lives to help reduce their risk. As a result, I continued my search to find data sources and construct the story I want to tell.
