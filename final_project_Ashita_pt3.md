# Final Project

Please access my final data story [here](https://preview.shorthand.com/uC6eBRpQWEdTaCO0).

## Background
While thinking about potential topics for my final project, I was browsing through news articles online. I found an article on NPR concerning cardiovascular disease. I knew that this condition had a high prevalence in the United States, but I was not aware that it caused death every 40 seconds. I became very interested in learning more about the causes of this condition and the precautionary measures we can take. I learned that many of the precautionary measures required long term changes in lifestyle such as increasing physicial activity and controlling diet. Knowing that I will be presenting to a young audience for my final presentation, I felt that it would be important to make people more aware of this condition and measures they can take early on in their lives to help reduce their risk. As a result, I continued my search to find data sources and construct the story I want to tell. 

## Part I 
What I did: 
- Outlined my project
- Created a story arc
- Documented my data sources
- Designed draft visualizations of my data
- Identified the method and medium I will use to present my story

## Part II
As I continued doing additional research, I found new data sources that were more relevant to the story I wanted to tell. As a result, I chose to eliminate a few of the data sources I initially found in completing Part I. 

What I did: 
- Identified new data sources
- Developed initial sketches of visualizations
- Created a draft version of my Shorthand page
- Conducted user research

## Part III
My intended audience for my final data story is composed of anyone who is looking for tips and resources to help them reduce their risk of developing cardiovascular disease. This could be inviduals who are health conscious in general or those that have been cautioned by their doctors to closely watch their health due to existing medical signs that signal a risk of developing heart disease. While more elderly people might be interested in my story, I also hope to reach out to the younger population to help raise awareness and foster a healthier diet early on.

Definining my audience helped me make better design choices. For instance, I chose to quantify "300 calories" by using common foods that my audience would be familiar with. I also chose to use pictures with minimal text to convey the message in a simple way. I constructing my data visualizations, I chose familiar chart types such as bar and line graphs as they are very easy to interpret. 

Additionally, the user research I conducted in Part II helped me identify the problem points in my story design and visualizations. Since many of the comments I received pertained to technical changes, I reached out again to the same indivudals to identify the underlying issues. I have listed my findings below: 

1) The inital title of the cardiovascular disease prevalence statistic graphic read "Death caused by cardiovascular disease". The user mentioned that while they initally understand the message of the graphic, it did not come to them automatically. Therefore, I changed tha title to "Cardiovascular disease causes death every...", which makes it direct and clear. 

2) One of the users mentioned that the axis titles in my second graphic need to be more clear. They actually meant that I should show the complete units. Previously, I had "Total calorie consumption", but I changed it to "Total daily calorie consumption". 

3) One of my users suggested that I add a second axis to the line chart to show the percent calorie consumption for each food category. However, I thought about this and decided not to make the change because adding a second y-axis will make a simple chart complex to understand and may create confusion. Furthermore, while the change in calorie values was significant, this was not reflected in the percent change and actually understated the significance of the rise. The user also mentioned that the original graph itself was simple to understand and only suggested adding the second-axis to provide an additional perspective. 

4) I changed the color scheme of the line chart to show that something that is "red" and hence "bad" is increasing and something that is "green" and hence "good" does not show much change. I added the labels of each line directly to the chart to eliminate any confusion around typical color associations for different food groups versus the colors I chose to use. 

5) In the "What should you do?" section, I chose to show pictures of foods rather than putting names on a graph. I felt that it would convey the information more effectively when people can actually see serving sizes and the corresponding sugar or saturated fat content. The user who suggested the graph idea also agreed that the pictures are effective in conveying the story I want to tell. 

One of the main things I learned in part III is to close the story loop. I started off by talking about cardiovascular disease at the beginning of my story, but quickly transitioned to calories and diets. As approached the end of my story, I was not satisfied as I felt something was missing. I spoke to a few individuals and they mentioned that I need to close the loop and tie my story back to cardiovascular disease. I did this by restating the title of my presentation at the very end. I felt this summarized the purpose of my story well and was simple and catchy for my audience to remember.
