# Final Project

While thinking about potential topics for my final project, I was browsing the news articles online. I found an article on NPR concerning cardiovascular disease. I knew that it had a high prevalence in the United States, but I was not aware that it caused death every 40 seconds. 

## Part I
What I did: 
- Outlined my project
- Created a story arc
- Documented my data sources
- Designed draft visualizations of my data
- Identified the method and medium I will use to present my story
